# AWS Security Scripts

## s3_regions.py

A comprehensive S3 bucket accessibility checker that tests for publicly accessible buckets across all AWS regions, using both AWS CLI and web-based checks. Tests bucket permissions for GET, PUT, and DELETE operations to identify full write access.

### Features
- Tests bucket accessibility via HTTP and HTTPS
- Checks AWS CLI access across all AWS regions
- Tests PUT and DELETE permissions via both AWS CLI and HTTP/S
- Tests over 70 bucket name variations and patterns
- Checks multiple URL formats for each bucket variation:
  - Direct bucket access (bucket.com)
  - Standard S3 endpoints (bucket.s3.amazonaws.com)
  - Regional endpoints (bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com)
  - Hyphenated endpoints (bucket.s3-region.amazonaws.com)
  - Website endpoints (bucket.s3-website.region.amazonaws.com)
  - Dualstack endpoints (bucket.s3.dualstack.region.amazonaws.com)
- Extended S3 feature support including requester pays settings
- Custom message input for PUT/DELETE tests with options to: test only PUT, test both PUT and DELETE, or skip all write tests
- Color-coded output (red for HTTP, green for HTTPS)
- Threaded concurrent processing for faster results
- Progress counter for visibility
- Real-time feedback on accessible buckets
- Automatic TLS/SSL certificate validation bypass for HTTPS endpoints
- Configurable concurrency via thread control

### Usage
```bash
python3 s3_regions.py -b bucket_name [-c] [-w] [-v] [-t THREADS]
```

Options:
- `-b, --bucket`: Specify the bucket name to check (required)
- `-c, --cli-only`: Only perform AWS CLI checks
- `-w, --web-only`: Only perform web checks
- `-v, --verbose`: Show verbose output (all attempts)
- `-t, --threads`: Number of concurrent threads for web checks (default: 30)

By default, both CLI and web checks are performed.

### Example
```bash
python3 s3_regions.py -b acme-corp.com
```

Example Output:
```
==== S3 Bucket Accessibility Check ====
Base name: acme-corp.com
Mode: Both Web and CLI checks

Enter the message to put in your test file (cannot be empty):
> This is a security test. Contact security@example.com if found.

Choose testing options:
  y - Test ONLY PUT operations (skip DELETE)
  n - Test both PUT and DELETE operations
  s - Skip all write tests (no PUT or DELETE)
Your choice [y/N/s]: n
Will perform both PUT and DELETE checks.

Using test message: 'This is a security test. Contact security@example.com if found.'

[AWS CLI] Found: s3://acme-corp.com No Region (objects: 1342) (PUT, DELETE)
[AWS CLI] Found: s3://acme-corp.com us-east-1 (objects: 1342) (PUT)
[AWS CLI] Found: s3://acme-corp.com us-east-2 (objects: 1342)
[Web] Accessible: http://acme-corp.com.s3.amazonaws.com (PUT, DELETE)
[Web] Accessible: https://acme-corp.com.s3.amazonaws.com (DELETE)
[Web] Accessible: http://acme-corp.com.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

Base bucket 'acme-corp.com' is accessible!
```

### Workflow
1. Parse command line arguments
2. Initialize variables and regions list
3. Prompt user for:
   - Custom message to use in test file
   - Testing options (PUT-only, PUT+DELETE, or skip all write tests)
4. Generate bucket name variations
5. If CLI checks enabled:
   - Check bucket accessibility via AWS CLI across all regions
   - Track number of objects in each accessible bucket
   - If write tests enabled, test PUT operations with AWS CLI (--no-sign-request) using custom message
   - If DELETE testing enabled, test DELETE operations only after successful PUT
   - Report which write operations succeed for each accessible bucket
6. If Web checks enabled:
   - Generate all endpoint URLs for each bucket variation
   - Check HTTP/HTTPS accessibility of each URL concurrently
   - Detect S3 bucket listings via `<ListBucketResult xmlns=` pattern
   - If write tests enabled, test PUT operations via HTTP/S for accessible buckets
   - If DELETE testing enabled, test DELETE operations only after successful PUT
   - Report accessible buckets with color-coded URLs and write permissions
7. Display summary of results

### Bucket Name Variations
The script tests multiple variations of the provided bucket name, including:
- Base name
- www. prefix/suffix
- Domain-style variations
- Environment prefixes/suffixes (dev, staging, prod, etc.)
- Common prefixes/suffixes (logs, backups, assets, etc.)
- S3-specific variations
- Hyphen/underscore variants
- And many more...

### Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- AWS CLI (optional, for CLI checks)
